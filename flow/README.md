1, change docker-compose file

2, setup google cloud 

3, change the header information in code and upload files and code in kestra

4, run flow

5, iterating 100 tickers needs CPU and memory, if it not working just run 5-10 manually.    

Note: ticker 'GOOGL' will fail for flow company public filing business section, because filings are under 'GOOG'   
i ignore this error for now. will update to catch it later.
